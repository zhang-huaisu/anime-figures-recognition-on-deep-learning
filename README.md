# anime-figures-recognition-on-deep-learning
It is my graduation project
There are two parts of my project:
1.read the Dataset of images into arrays and import them to the nerual networks.
2.define the network by the functions of TensorFlow which can learn from the Dataset with labels.
3.Train the network to minimize the loss function and maxmize the test accuray.
4.plot the chart of test accury and loss funciton.
