       <td>1.read the Dataset of images into arrays and import them to the nerual networks.</td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
       <td>2.define the network by the functions of TensorFlow which can learn from the Dataset with labels.</td>

   <tr>
       <td>3.Train the network to minimize the loss function and maxmize the test accuracy.</td>
